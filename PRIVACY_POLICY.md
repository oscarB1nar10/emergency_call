# Emergency call: Privacy policy

## Welcome to the Emergency call app for Android!

Here at Oscar Ramirez we are committed to taking care of the user's personal data, therefore the user has the total freedom to share personal data from our app (Emergency call) to external ones like WhatsApp or not. No users' personal information is collected at all, all the personal data is persisted in memory and in the cache so it will be removed and lost when the app is closed or uninstalled.

 
The use of the data is merely functional and the retention of it is divided between in-memory and in-cache, for the first one the information is removed and lost when the app is closed, and for the second the information is removed from the cache (preferences) when the app is uninstalled.

 
We handle user information like contacts, location, and send of SMS only in a functional way in order to give the user the functionality promised.

We don't process or collect other types of data like payment information.


The third-party libraries used in order to process the user data are libraries that belong to Flutter and therefore these have the endorsement, safety, and quality.

 
The user has the total freedom to decide if share personal info (location) through WhatsApp, SMS, or not, the same way the user has always the freedom to remove the personal info stored in the cache.

All the changes in the privacy policy will require the user to take a look at those, that is why we have an in-app link where the user can go every time we notified to him through an update of the version that the privacy policy has been updated.


If the user finds any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by Oscar Ramirez's team or has any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Oscar Ramirez. Bogota', Colombia. oscivaram@gmail.com
