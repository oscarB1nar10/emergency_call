# Emergency call: Privacy policy

## Welcome to the Emergency call app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Oscar Ramirez.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (personal contacts) present on your device won't be treated or sent to a remote server.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Oscar Ramirez.
Bogota', Colombia.
